# EnviroSpect
COEN 390 Project

EnviroSpect is an android application software that allows users to monitor the surrounding air quality and sound level in their environment. The application retrieves its data through Bluetooth connection to a physical device containing a microcontroller, a sound sensor, and an air quality sensor. Through a click on the application, users can obtain readings for the sound level and the air quality in their surrounding environment, accompanied by a short infographic interpreting the results in terms of safety level.

Through this application, users will be able to get instantaneous readings of their environment throughout the day as well as a daily & real time review of their readings. Additionally, the app allows users to set their own custom threshold for audio levels if they wish to do so to get notified when the noise in their  environment exceeds the threshold level . This application is mainly intended for blue-collar workers, and individuals who spend an extended amount of time working in a noisy and/or fume-laden environment. Through EnviroSpect, users will be able to monitor their surrounding environment and limit their exposure to toxic air and high sound levels accordingly.
